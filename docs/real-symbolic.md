Arc of the class
Questions to Consider

_Question_
In what ways did the Naturalism of Zola and the Symbolism of Maeterlinck attempt to deal with the dilemma faced by artists in the modern world? How were they different?

_Question_
In what ways did Zola’s Naturalism shift assumptions about drama and its function?

_Question_
Strindberg called his experiments with dramatic form and content a “New Naturalism.” Others have called them Symbolist. Is Symbolism a response to or an outgrowth of Naturalism?
