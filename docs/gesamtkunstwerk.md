 "In 'Retour a la musique" (1906), Appia criticized the passivity of the public which allowed a work of art to be placed "in front of us, outside of us . . . it is there, we are here, always distinct.' He blamed this passivity ("anaesthesia") in part on the theatres, 'ugly and built contrary to good sense." In 1908, Appia wrote: 'In our modern theatres, the places meant for the public are as dis tinct as possible from the space where the action takes place; and perfection seems to us attained at Bayreuth: there, the proscenium frame is no more than an immense key hole (pardon me!) through which we indiscretely surprise mysteries which are not meant for us"[^1]
